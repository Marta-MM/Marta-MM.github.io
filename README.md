## Marta Mangiarulo, PhD.

I hold an MSc in Social Psychology and a Ph.D. in Cognitive and Brain Sciences.
My main research interests involve probabilistic inference, social hypothesis testing, and reasoning biases; additionally, I am passionate about science communication and research dissemination and interested in replicability, open science issues and the interface between cognitive and social aspects in social psychology topics like intergroup relations and impression formation.
